Flying has changed our lives. In 2021 my family and I moved to the Pacific Northwest (PNW). In 2022 we purchased a 1977 Beechcraft Bonanza A36. In 2023 and beyond we will be exploring the wonders of the Pacific Northwest. Discover the stunning beauty of the Pacific Northwest through our aerial journeys, as we capture mesmerizing footage from the cockpit. Whether it's soaring over snow-capped mountains, exploring pristine coastal areas, or landing in charming airports, we'll bring you along for the ride. Join us as we embark on thrilling adventures, showcasing the breathtaking landscapes, hidden gems, and vibrant communities of this magnificent region. 

As passionate aviators and aircraft owners, we'll share our knowledge and experiences in navigating the realm of airplane ownership, traveling with kids, and other lessons weâ€™ve learned along the way..
