Every few months I see a post in aviation related Facebook groups about how to file for practice instrument approaches in the Seattle area. When I was getting my instrument rating, I did so through <a href="https://www.avianflight.com/" target="_blank">Avian Flight Center</a> out of Bremerton, Washington (KPWT). They had a number of resources that were incredibly helpful, including a cheat sheat for filing IFR in the Seattle area.

<h2>Approach codes for the Seattle area</h2>

Seattle Approach requests that you use this system to concisely indicate your approach requests for local instrument currency/training flights when an IFR flight plan is filed. Place the following approach request codes in the <strong>REMARKS</strong> section of your <strong>IFR</strong> flight plan.

For each desired approach, enter the first character for the <strong>AIRPORT</strong>, the second for the <strong>APPROACH</strong> requested, and the third for how the approach will <strong>TERMINATE</strong>:

|1st Character - Airport|2nd Character - Approach|3rd Character - Termination|
|---|---|---|
|A - Arlington (KAWO)|I - ILS|F - Full stop|
|N - Auburn (S50)|L - Localizer or Localizer + DME|M - Published missed approach|
|B - Boeing (KBFI)|G - RNAV/GPS|L - Request alternate missed approach|
|K -Bremerton (KPWT)|V - VOR or VOR + DME|C - Cancel with the Tower|
|G - Gray Army Airfield (KGRF)|T - TACAN||
|T - McChord Field (KTCM)|P - PAR||
|O - Olympia (KOLM)|N - NDB||
|P - Paine Field (KPAE)|||
|R - Renton (KRNT)|||
|H - Shelton/Sanderson (KSHN)|||
|W - Tacoma Narrows (KTIW)|||
|X - Thun Field/Pierce County (PLU)|||

<h3>Example</h3> 
You file <strong>IFR BFI to BFI</strong>, and want to do approaches at <strong>PWT</strong> and <strong>TIW</strong>. 

If your request was to fly the <strong>ILS-20 @ PWT</strong> to a <strong>missed approach</strong>, followed by a <strong>LOC-17 @ TIW</strong> to a <strong>missed approach</strong>, then the <strong>ILS @ BFI</strong>, to a <strong>full stop</strong>. In the REMARKS section of your IFR flight plan, enter <strong>KIM, WLM, BIF</strong>. 

<h3>Notes</h3>

* Do <ins>not</ins> use these codes when making approach requests on frequency. Always state approach requests made over the radio in plain English.

* Make sure you put these codes in the REMARKS section of your flight plan, <ins>not</ins> in the ROUTE section! If you wish to request a specific departure procedure, you should list that departure procedure in the ROUTE section. <strong>Example: BFI..NRVNA1..BFI</strong>

* These codes – and this system – is unique to the Seattle Approach. If you are practicing approaches elsewhere, put “<strong>Multiple Approaches</strong>” in the REMARKS section of your flight plan.

* These codes may be used when filing online via e.g. DUATS, and usually when filing via a telephone call to FSS (1-800-WXBRIEF). 

* If you have a special request or change your mind after you are airborne, let the controller know.

* Seattle TRACON will try its best to accommodate your request. Be prepared for possible changes in your flight plan.
